Project Title: DataWorld

Was asked to deliver a website with a subject that I like, so I brought to you DataWorld. A website to help people get into data and explaining the importance
of it. The aim of the website is to get a person without much knowledge on the subject, and help them understand the basics of data and machine learning.

By the end the guest leaves the website, they are expected to be hungry to learn more about the subject!
