        <p>The concept of big data has been around for years; most organizations now understand that if they capture all the data that streams into their businesses,
           they can apply analytics and get significant value from it. But even in the 1950s, decades before anyone uttered the term “big data,” businesses were
           using basic analytics (essentially numbers in a spreadsheet that were manually examined) to uncover insights and trends.</p>
        <p>The new benefits that big data analytics brings to the table, however, are speed and efficiency. Whereas a few years ago a business would have gathered
           information, run analytics and unearthed information that could be used for future decisions, today that business can identify insights for immediate
            decisions. The ability to work faster – and stay agile – gives organizations a competitive edge they didn’t have before.</p>

          <h2>Decision Tree</h2>
          <p>A decision tree is a supervised learning method for classification. Algorithms of this variety create trees that predict the result
            of an input vector based on decision rules inferred from the features present in the data. Decision trees are useful because they're
            easy to visualize so you can understand the factors that lead to a result.</p>

          <h4>Bagging</h4>
          <p>Bagging is the way decrease the variance of your prediction by generating additional data for training from your original dataset using
             combinations with repetitions to produce multistep of the same carnality/size as your original data. By increasing the size of your training
              set you can’t improve the model predictive force, but just decrease the variance, narrowly tuning the prediction to expected outcome.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Boosting </h4>
          <p>Boosting is an approach to calculate the output using several different models and then average the result using a weighted average approach.
            By combining the advantages and pitfalls of these approaches by varying your weighting formula you can come up with a good predictive force for
            a wider range of input data, using different narrowly tuned models.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Random forest</h4>
          <p>The random forest algorithm is actually very similar to bagging. Also here, you draw random bootstrap samples of your training set.
            However, in addition to the bootstrap samples, you also draw a random subset of features for training the individual trees; in bagging, you give
            each tree the full set of features. Due to the random feature selection, you make the trees more independent of each other compared to regular bagging,
            which often results in better predictive performance (due to better variance-bias trade-offs) and it’s also faster, because each tree learns only from a
             subset of features.</p>

          <h2>Linear Regression</h2><br>
          <p>In statistics, linear regression is a method to predict a target variable by fitting the best linear relationship between the dependent and independent
            variable. The best fit is done by making sure that the sum of all the distances between the shape and the actual observations at each point is as small
             as possible. The fit of the shape is “best” in the sense that no other position would produce less error given the choice of shape. 2 major types of
              linear regression are Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression. Simple Linear Regression uses a single independent variable to predict
               a dependent variable by fitting a best linear relationship. Multiple Linear Regression uses more than one independent variable to predict a dependent
                variable by fitting a best linear relationship. Make sure to <a href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/ml-regression/the-simple-linear-regression-model-N8p7w">see more</a>!</p>

          <p>Classification is a data mining technique that assigns categories to a collection of data in order to aid in more accurate predictions and analysis.
             Also sometimes called a Decision Tree, classification is one of several methods intended to make the analysis of very large datasets effective.
