        <p>This is a site dedicated to data!</p>
        <p>The concept of big data has been around for years; most organizations now understand that if they capture all the data that streams into their businesses,
           they can apply analytics and get significant value from it. But even in the 1950s, decades before anyone uttered the term “big data,” businesses were
           using basic analytics (essentially numbers in a spreadsheet that were manually examined) to uncover insights and trends.</p>
        <p>The new benefits that big data analytics brings to the table, however, are speed and efficiency. Whereas a few years ago a business would have gathered
           information, run analytics and unearthed information that could be used for future decisions, today that business can identify insights for immediate
            decisions. The ability to work faster – and stay agile – gives organizations a competitive edge they didn’t have before.</p>
